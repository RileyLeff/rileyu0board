# Riley U0 Board

This is a hello world project in kicad. Just learning my way around.

Attempting to design a little board for a STM32U0 MCU.

Down the road (maybe a long time from now) I'd like to develop some open-source hardware projects as cheaper, more tractable alternatives to commercial scientific tools. I have a suspicion that the hobbyist electronics market is a severely under-utilized asset in ecological research.
